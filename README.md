# Future 50 Growth Expansion Intelligence 

**1.Project Overview**

The Future 50 Growth & Expansion Intelligence Dashboard is a strategic Business Intelligence solution designed to analyze and monitor the performance of high-growth, emerging restaurant chains.

The project focuses on answering a critical business question:

Which fast-growing restaurant brands are scaling successfully, and where are the strongest opportunities for expansion, investment, and operational optimization?

Using structured industry data, the dashboard transforms raw figures into actionable insights around sales performance, unit growth, franchising strategy, geographic concentration, and operational efficiency.
The final deliverable is a decision-ready Power BI dashboard built for executives, investors, and strategy teams.

**2.Project Scope**

**This project covers:**

- Performance analysis of 50 high-growth restaurant brands
- Evaluation of sales, units, and year-over-year growth
- Comparison between franchised vs non-franchised models
- Geographic performance by city and state
- Identification of top performers, efficiency leaders, and expansion hotspots
  
**Out of scope:**

- Financial forecasting beyond existing YoY metrics
- Cost or margin analysis (not available in the dataset)
- Store-level operational metrics

**3.Methodology**

The project followed a structured end-to-end BI workflow:

**a. Data Understanding**

- Reviewed dataset structure, metrics, and categorical fields
- Identified growth indicators, efficiency metrics, and geographic dimensions
  
**b. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)**

- Cleaned percentage fields (YoY metrics)
- Standardized restaurant names and location fields
- Handled missing and “UNKNOWN” values
- Ensured correct data types for numerical analysis
- Created calculated columns for performance ratios
  
**c. Data Modeling**

- Built a clean star-like model for reporting
- Optimized relationships for slicing by restaurant, city, state, and franchising status
  
**d. KPI & Measure Development (DAX)**

- Designed business-focused KPIs
- Ensured measures were aggregation-safe and filter-aware
  
**e. Visualization & Storytelling**

- Designed executive-friendly visuals
- Applied consistent layout, hierarchy, and color logic
- Focused on clarity over decoration

**4.Data Source**

- Source: Publicly available restaurant industry dataset (Future 50)
- Data Type: Structured tabular data
- Granularity: Restaurant-level performance metrics
- Time Dimension: Year-over-Year growth indicators

**5.Tools Used**

- Power BI – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard development
- Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation
- Microsoft Excel – Initial data inspection and validation
- (Optional workflow compatible with SQL & Python for scaling)

  **6.KPIs, Results & Key Findings**
  
**Core KPIs Tracked**

- Total Sales
- Total Unit Volume
- Sales per Unit (Efficiency KPI)
- Year-over-Year Sales Growth
- Year-over-Year Unit Growth
- Restaurant Count
- Geographic Coverage (States & Cities)
  
**Key Findings**

- High sales do not always equal high efficiency
Some brands outperform others significantly on a sales-per-unit basis despite smaller scale.
- Franchised brands dominate growth metrics
Franchising shows stronger cumulative YoY sales and unit expansion compared to non-franchised models.
- Growth is geographically concentrated
A small number of states and cities account for a disproportionate share of total sales.
- Top performers show balanced growth
The strongest brands combine unit expansion + sales efficiency, not just rapid scaling.

**7.Recommendations**

Based on the analysis:

**1.	Prioritize efficiency alongside expansion**
Brands with high sales per unit should be favored for scaling decisions.

**2.	Leverage franchising strategically**
Franchised models demonstrate stronger growth scalability within this dataset.

**3.	Focus expansion on proven geographies**
Cities and states with strong sales density should be used as expansion anchors.

**4.	Monitor YoY growth trends continuously**
Growth momentum is as important as absolute performance for emerging brands.

**8.Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how Business Intelligence transforms raw growth data into strategic insight.
By combining clean data modeling, meaningful KPIs, and executive-focused storytelling, the dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions about expansion, investment, and operational focus.
Beyond the technical execution, the project reflects a strong understanding of business context, analytical rigor, and professional reporting standards—skills directly transferable to real-world BI and data analyst roles.
